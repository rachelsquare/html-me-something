                        <p>
                            I arrived in Vancouver with my friend Chris after a long journey, consisting of a roadtrip and two flights.

                        <h2>Mountains Here We Come</h2>
                        <p>
                            Our friends, who  had driven from Seattle, picked us up at the airport and we heded into the mountains after a quick bite in the city.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Upon arriving in Squamish, we loaded up on groceries. The view wasn't bad from the store's parking lot, either.

                        <p>
                            Our first night at camp was just the four of us. We made a great dinner with Sockeye salmon and veggies.

                            More friends arrived from Seattle the next day, and we took our first hike.

                            It ended up being more trecherous than we had expected.
                        </p>

                            But, it was worth it in the end.

                            Back at camp, friends continued to arrive from all over, and we spent some quality time together.

                            The next morning, we found some old traincars behind our campsite.
